# Frequently Asked Questions

You have questions. We have answers. If you do not find a satisfactory answer here, please contact us at [support@codecomet.io](mailto:support@codecomet.io).

**Does CodeComet replace my existing CI?**
> It could, but it doesn't have to. CodeComet can be configured to run in parallel to your existing CI system. This is ideal when initially testing out the system. Once you are confident that the system meets your needs, you can switch over.

**Can I test this in tandem with my existing CI?**
> Yes, you definitely can. It does not interfere with existing CI setups.

**What does Private Beta entail?**
> We are an early-stage startup actively developing our initial product. At the moment, we only have enough resources to manually onboard individual users and small teams to trial our service, evaluate whether it fits their needs and provide us with feedback. In short, we are not yet ready for primetime.

**How secure is this system? Is my company's data safe?**
> Everything runs on your local machine at the moment. (We plan on having a hosted management layer in the future, but this is not part of the initial solution.) The only data that leaves the local machine are metrics relating to Pipeline health and performance. We currently use a hosted version of Elastic (specifically, Kibana) to display dashboards of these metrics.

**How much does this cost?**
> CodeComet is currently free and does not have any usage or feature restrictions. While we intend to charge for the service in the future, at the moment we are focused on getting this into the hands of interested users and gathering feedback on its utility.
