# ExecutionContext

An ExecutionContext is typically a predefined operating system, like Debian, and usually some pre-installed applications as well, to assist in the Action or Pipeline execution.

ExecutionContext can be thought of as the environment within which an Action, or an entire Pipeline, is executed. If you are familiar with containers, then this is basically our lingo for that.
