# Pipeline Analysis

CodeComet has first-class support for logging and monitoring. At the moment, the system forwards Pipeline execution details to Elastic. Through Elastic's Kibana interface, you can quickly examine the results of a single Pipeline execution.

We currently surface details such as:
* Pipeline Runtime
* Pipeline Status
* Percentage of Actions Cached
* Percentage of Actions Successful
* Actions that Errored
* Action Runtimes
* Details of All Actions that Executed
