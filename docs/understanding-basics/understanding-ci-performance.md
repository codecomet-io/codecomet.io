# Understanding CI Performance

It's one thing to have visibility into an individual Pipeline execution. But what if you want to look at the overall health and performance of your CI system?

CodeComet also offers a roll-up view of how all the Pipelines across your organization are running, in aggregate.

We currently surface details such as:
* **Usage and Reliability**
  * Number of Pipeline Executions over Time
  * Total Number of Pipeline Executions
* **Cost**
  * Total Pipeline Execution Runtimes over Time
  * Total Pipeline Execution Runtime
* **Efficiency**
  * Average Pipeline Execution Runtimes over Time
  * Overall Average Pipeline Execution Runtime
* **Worst Offenders**
  * Pipelines with the Longest Total Runtimes
  * Pipelines with the Longest Average Runtimes
  * Pipelines Most Frequently Executed
  * Pipelines with the Highest Error Rates
  * Pipelines with the Highest Uncached Rates
